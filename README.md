# QWOP-Bot
This is a bot to play QWOP, written with web sockets and python.

## Details

To get this working I scraped foddy.net and grabbed the HTML5 QWOP, I then removed restrictions to make it run locally.
Next I set up a web socket between the browser and a python server.

Now I had two way transfer between the game and python So I could begin sending inputs to the game and recieving output from the variables in the game.
